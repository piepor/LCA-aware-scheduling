**LCA aware scheduling**

Functions to reproduce the results of the paper "Machine learning to forecast electricity hourly LCA impacts due to a dynamic electricity technology mix". 

"main.py" and "main_direct_impact.py" will train the two different model types as explained in the paper. To visualize the results use "plot_residuals.py" , "plot_hourly_distributions.py" and "plot_statistics.py "
